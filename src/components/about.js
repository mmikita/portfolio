        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I'm a web developer interested in technologies like Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, various frameworks and other technologies. I also know CMSs like Wordpress, Joomla and Prestashop.
        I enjoy challenges at work like learning new technologies in new projects and figuring out how to handle a new environment. I love to master new technologies and I think that learning new things isn't just the smart thing to do, it's really necessary to not to fall into stagnation and routine. Creating websites frontend and backend is my work and passion.
